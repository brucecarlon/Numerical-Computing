# Monte Carlo Simulation: Pi Estimation

This program estimates pi by considering a unit circle enclosed in a square.
In order to estimate pi, the hit and miss method was employed, we consider
a 2 x 2 square piece of paper with an inscribed circle of radius 1, we then simulate throwing
darts at the sqaure and we have the following relations:
    
 $$\frac{number\ of\ dots\ inside\ circle}{total\ number\ of\ dots\} = \frac{area\ of\ circle}{area\ of\ square}$$
